## HowFar functionality

Do you ever wonder what the (shortest) distance is between two cities? 

Wonder no more and visit: 

<https://ido-doesburg.shinyapps.io/HowFar/>.

Simply type the city you live in and push the button "Make this my home location".

Then type the name of another city and the distance in kilometers is shown.


## Limitations

- Not all cities are recognized; only cities in the R dataset "world.cities".
- Some cities in the world have the same name. This results in an error in the calculated distance field. I should resolve this some time...
